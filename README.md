# standing-tracker
A web-application to monitor and log your standing time at a sit-stand desk, promoting healthier work habits.
## Features
- **User Interface**: Intuitive, minimalistic UI for easy interaction in a dark theme (as all software should be).
- **Session Tracking**: Start and stop timers to record standing sessions.
- **Total Time Tracking**: Track total time spent standing (*gamification*).
- **Data Logging**: Persistent storage of session data for historical reference.

Still heavily WIP (total time does not dynamically update, no highscore functionality, no protection against cross site request forgery; however the app is supposed to be local-only)
